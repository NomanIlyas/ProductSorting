Story

Our product manager wants to AB test different product sortings to see which one makes the most sales. It is possible that on different parts of your website different sortings turn out to be most effective.



Task

You get an unsorted array of products and you are required to sort it. Please extend the code below to allow the given products to be returned in sorted order either by

price
the ratio of sales per view (sales_count divided by views_count)
depending on the context. It should be extensible to that in theory different teams could add their own sorters, thus you may make each sorter seperate from the rest.



Notes

You don't have to put the classes into different files, but instead write them all in the following text area.
You are highly encouraged to design the code following the SOLID principles.
We know the text area isn't ideal for coding, so feel free to use your own IDE. Feel free to look up commands on Google/Stackoverflow as well.
